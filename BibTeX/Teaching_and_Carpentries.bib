	abstract = {From the Inside Flap: Any conversation about effective teaching must begin with a consideration of how students learn. However, instructors may find a gap between resources that focus on the technical research on learning and those that provide practical classroom strategies. How Learning Works provides the bridge for such a gap. In this volume, the authors introduce seven general principles of learning, distilled from the research literature as well as from twenty-seven years of experience working one-on-one with college faculty. They have drawn on research from a breadth of perspectives (cognitive, developmental, and social psychology; educational research; anthropology; demographics; and organizational behavior) to identify a set of key principles underlying learning-from how effective organization enhances retrieval and use of information to what impacts motivation. These principles provide instructors with an understanding of student learning that can help them see why certain teaching approaches are or are not supporting student learning, generate or refine teaching approaches and strategies that more effectively foster student learning in specific contexts, and transfer and apply these principles to new courses. For anyone who wants to improve his or her students' learning, it is crucial to understand how that learning works and how to best foster it. This vital resource is grounded in learning theory and based on research evidence, while being easy to understand and apply to college teaching.},

	abstract = {Data is the central currency of science, but the nature of scientific data has changed dramatically with the rapid pace of technology. This change has led to the development of a wide variety of data formats, dataset sizes, data complexity, data use cases, and data sharing practices. Improvements in high throughput DNA sequencing, sustained institutional support for large sensor networks, and sky surveys with large-format digital cameras have created massive quantities of data. At the same time, the combination of increasingly diverse research teams and data aggregation in portals (e.g. for biodiversity data, GBIF or iDigBio) necessitates increased coordination among data collectors and institutions. As a consequence, “data” can now mean anything from petabytes of information stored in professionally-maintained databases, through spreadsheets on a single computer, to hand-written tables in lab notebooks on shelves. All remain important, but data curation practices must continue to keep pace with the changes brought about by new forms and practices of data collection and storage.},

	abstract = {Weather and climate science has undergone a computational revolution in recent decades, to the point where all modern research relies heavily on software and code. Despite this profound change in the research methods employed by weather and climate scientists, the reporting of computational results has changed very little in relevant academic journals. This lag has led to something of a reproducibility crisis, whereby it is impossible to replicate and verify most of today’s published computational results. While it is tempting to simply decry the slow response of journals and funding agencies in the face of this crisis, there are very few examples of reproducible weather and climate research upon which to base new communication standards. In an attempt to address this deficiency, this essay describes a procedure for reporting computational results that was employed in a recent Journal of Climate paper. The procedure was developed to be consistent with recommended computational best practices and seeks to minimize the time burden on authors, which has been identified as the most important barrier to publishing code. It should provide a starting point for weather and climate scientists looking to publish reproducible research, and it is proposed that journals could adopt the procedure as a minimum standard.},

	abstract = {Computer programming was once thought of as a skill required only by professional software developers. But today, given the ubiquitous nature of computation and data science it is quickly becoming necessary for all scientists and engineers to have at least a basic knowledge of how to program. Teaching how to program, particularly to those students with little or no computing background, is well-known to be a difficult task. However, there is also a wealth of evidence-based teaching practices for teaching programming skills which can be applied to greatly improve learning outcomes and the student experience. Adopting these practices naturally gives rise to greater learning efficiency - this is critical if programming is to be integrated into an already busy geoscience curriculum. This paper considers an undergraduate computer programming course, run during the last 5 years in the Department of Earth Science and Engineering at Imperial College London. The teaching methodologies that were used each year are discussed alongside the challenges that were encountered, and how the methodologies affected student performance. Anonymised student marks and feedback are used to highlight this, and also how the adjustments made to the course eventually resulted in a highly effective learning environment.},

	abstract = {Background:
              This paper reports the results of an evaluation of the Software Sustainability Institute’s Fellowship Programme, which focused on identifying and categorising the benefits that the fellowship has afforded its recipients, via a series of open questions.
            
            
              Methods:
              The evaluation took the form of a survey open to people awarded Fellowships between 2012 and 2016, which asked people to report the effect that the programme had had on them, their institutions, their research domains and their careers.
            
            
              Results:
              The results show that the Fellowship plays a wide-ranging role in supporting communities of best practice and skills transfer, and that a significant benefit is the way it has raised the profile of software in research, and those people who develop and advocate for it.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              The evaluation of the programme has shown the need to support research software
              in situ
              and credit the engineers and researchers who are working in this important area that supports reproducibility, reuse and the integrity of research investments.},

As biomedical data-sets increase in size, variety and complexity, they challenge conventional methods for sharing, managing and analyzing those data. In May 2017, we convened a two-day meeting between the BD2K Training Coordinating Center (TCC), ELIXIR Training/TeSS, GOBLET, H3ABioNet, EMBL-ABR, bioCADDIE and the CSIRO, in Huntington Beach, California, to compare and contrast our respective activities, and how these might be leveraged for wider impact on an international scale. Discussions focused on the role of i) training for biomedical data science; ii) the need to promote core competencies, and the ii) development of career paths. These led to specific conversations about i) the values of standardizing and sharing data science training resources; ii) challenges in encouraging adoption of training material standards; iii) strategies and best practices for the personalization and customization of learning experiences; iv) processes of identifying stakeholders and determining how they should be accommodated; and v) discussions of joint partnerships to lead the world on data science training in ways that benefit all stakeholders. Generally, international cooperation was viewed as essential for accommodating the widest possible participation in the modern bioscience enterprise, providing skills in a truly “FAIR” manner, addressing the importance of data science understanding worldwide. Several recommendations for the exchange of educational frameworks are made, along with potential sources for support, and plans for further cooperative efforts are presented.},

              (Galaxy Community Conference and Bioinformatics Open Source Conference) attracted over 300 participants from around the world. The meeting started with two days of training, followed by two days of talks and poster/demo sessions (with some joint and some parallel sessions). The joint sessions included well-received keynote talks by Tracy Teal, Fernando Pérez and Lucia Peixoto, as well as a panel discussion about documentation and training. After the main meeting, many attendees stayed for up to four additional collaboration days, an extended version of the Codefests that have been held in conjunction with previous BOSCs. GCCBOSC was a successful experiment. The organizers concluded that the best way to serve the broadest community of potential BOSC attendees will be to partner some years with the International Society for Computational Biology (ISMB) and others with GCC.},

	abstract = {In the 21st Century, research is increasingly data- and computation-driven. Researchers, funders, and the larger community today emphasize the traits of openness and reproducibility. In March 2017, 13 mostly early-career research leaders who are building their careers around these traits came together with ten university leaders (presidents, vice presidents, and vice provosts), representatives from four funding agencies, and eleven organizers and other stakeholders in an NIH- and NSF-funded one-day, invitation-only workshop titled "Imagining Tomorrow's University." Workshop attendees were charged with launching a new dialog around open research – the current status, opportunities for advancement, and challenges that limit sharing.
            The workshop examined how the internet-enabled research world has changed, and how universities need to change to adapt commensurately, aiming to understand how universities can and should make themselves competitive and attract the best students, staff, and faculty in this new world. During the workshop, the participants re-imagined scholarship, education, and institutions for an open, networked era, to uncover new opportunities for universities to create value and serve society. They expressed the results of these deliberations as a set of 22 principles of tomorrow's university across six areas: credit and attribution, communities, outreach and engagement, education, preservation and reproducibility, and technologies.
            Activities that follow on from workshop results take one of three forms. First, since the workshop, a number of workshop authors have further developed and published their white papers to make their reflections and recommendations more concrete. These authors are also conducting efforts to implement these ideas, and to make changes in the university system.  Second, we plan to organise a follow-up workshop that focuses on how these principles could be implemented. Third, we believe that the outcomes of this workshop support and are connected with recent theoretical work on the position and future of open knowledge institutions.},

	abstract = {Software is data, but it is not just data. While "data" in computing and information science can refer to anything that can be processed by a computer, software is a special kind of data that can be a creative, executable tool that operates on data. However, software and data are similar in that they both traditionally have not been cited in publications. This paper discusses the differences between software and data in the context of citation, by providing examples and referring to evidence in the form of citations.},
